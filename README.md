## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Mobipay application on your local machine.

Here's the updated list of **prerequisites** to include Firebase setup for a Flutter project:

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Install Flutter:**
   - Follow the [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install Flutter on your machine.
   
2. **Install Dart SDK:**
   - Dart comes pre-installed with Flutter, so installing Flutter will automatically install Dart as well. However, if needed, you can install Dart separately by following the [Dart installation guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

3. **Install a Code Editor:**
   - Use a code editor like **VS Code** or **Android Studio** for Flutter development.
     - [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
     - [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

4. **Install Firebase:**
   - **Create a Firebase Project:**
     - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), and click on "Add Project".
     - Follow the steps to create your Firebase project.
   - **Configure Firebase with Flutter:**
     - Follow the instructions in the Firebase console to set up Firebase with your Flutter project.
     - Add Firebase dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
       ```yaml
       dependencies:
         firebase_core: ^1.10.0
         firebase_auth: ^3.3.3 # For Authentication
         # Include any other Firebase packages you need (e.g., Firestore, Firebase Database)
       ```
     - **Install Firebase SDK:** Ensure you have the Firebase SDK set up by running:
       ```bash
       flutter pub get
       ```

5. **Download the `google-services.json` File:**
   - **Firebase Project Configuration:**
     - In the Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings** > **General**.
     - Scroll down to **Your apps** and select the Android app you want to configure.
     - Download the `google-services.json` file.
   - **Place the `google-services.json` File:**
     - Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory of your Flutter project.
     - Make sure the file is located exactly in `project_directory/android/app/google-services.json`.

6. **Set Up Firebase for Android:**
   - Open `android/build.gradle` and add the following line in the `buildscript` section:
     ```gradle
     classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'  // Add this line
     ```
   - In `android/app/build.gradle`, at the bottom of the file, add:
     ```gradle
     apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'  // Add this line
     ```

7. **Run the Project:**
   - After completing the above steps, run your project using:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
